# Mental shape rotation

Found that shape rotation takes an linearly increasing amount of time when shapes were further rotated. Which seems like common sense until you consider that cognitive science had treated brains as storing information as bits. If that's so, there should be an algorithm which checks if one shape can map to another by rotation *without* needing to take an increasing amount of time. How then are we storing these images in our brains?

One hypothesis then is that we represent our vision as images which we rotate in our minds. Interesting study in how common observations, rotating shapes by larger degrees takes more time, can lead to higher level hypothesis of cognition.
